## Overview

Sol's on the Square is a beloved Korean restaurant in Madison, Wisconsin. Noticing that their paper menus lacked images and didn't cater to the linguistic needs of their significant Chinese clientele, I decided to lend a hand. As a friend of the owner and eager to hone my React skills, I developed this website to enhance the dining experience for all patrons.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Seamlessly switch between English, Korean, and Chinese to accommodate our diverse clientele.
- **Smooth Scrolling Navigation**: Effortlessly browse through our menu categories, including appetizers, soups, rice dishes, and drinks, with smooth scrolling.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a flawless browsing experience on any device, whether itâ€™s a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
